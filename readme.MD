- topic to learn
# core of react (state or ui manipulation, jsx)
# component reusability
# reusing of component (props)
# how to propagate change (hooks)

# state management (react don't have state management) - redux, redux toolkit, zustand, context api
# class based component - legacy code
# baas apps - social media clone, e-commerce app
